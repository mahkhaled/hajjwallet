## Introduction

You will often need to modify the products in your store - prices may fluctuate, descriptions may change, you may take new photographs of your inventory. Spree makes it quick and easy to make such changes.

## Editing Products

To make changes to your product, go to your Admin Interface, click the "Products" tab, and click the "Edit" icon next to the product.

The edit form is the exact same one you use when [creating products](creating_products). See that guide for explanation of any of the fields when editing your product.
