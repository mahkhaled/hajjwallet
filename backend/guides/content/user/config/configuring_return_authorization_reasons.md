## Introduction

Before you make any Return you have to describe reasons, why the user wants to return the items. This is the place where you can create Reasons and name them.

Input name that will be present during Return process and click *Create* button. It is not necessary to activate Reason instantly. You can choose when you want to make a Return Reason active. For example you might want to create a Holiday refund reason - the user ordered something during holiday but wants to return it when you already deactived this certain reason.

Thats it, you have a reason to make refunds to the Users !
