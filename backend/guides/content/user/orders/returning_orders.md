## Introduction

Returns are a reality of doing business for most e-commerce sites. A customer may find that the item they ordered doesn't fit, or that it doesn't fit their needs. The product may be damaged in shipping. There are many reasons why a customer could choose to return an item they purchased in your store. This guide covers how you, as the site administrator, issue RMAs (Return Merchandise Authorizations) and process returns.

## Creating RMAs for Returns

You can only create RMAs for orders that have already been shipped. That makes sense, as you wouldn't authorize a return for something you haven't sent out yet.

To create an RMA for a shipped order, click the order's "Return Authorizations" link, then click the "New Return Authorization" button. The form that opens up enables you to select which items will be authorized to be returned, and issue an RMA for the corresponding amount.

To use it, just select each line item to be returned, either a reimbursement type or exchange item. Select Quantity of the items(s), its set to "1" by default. For example, customer wants to return a damaged item. Selecting the "Original" reimbursement type will refund a user back to their original payment method when the items are returned and approved.  Selecting an exchange item will create a new shipment to ship the exchange item to the customer.  The form will automatically calculate the RMA value based on the sale price of the item(s), but you will have to confirm the amount when the reimbursement is issued. This gives you a chance to adjust for handling fees, restocking fees, damages, etc.

Input the reason and any memo notes for the return, and select the [Stock Location](stock_locations) the item is coming back to. Click the "Create" button.

Now, you just need to wait for the package to be received at your location.

Even created Return Authorization can be edited or deleted. When the user changes his mind. As an Admin in your shop, you can still make additional changes to Return action.

Inside of the Return Authorization Edit, its the same layout as creating one. Just simply make changes and press **Update** button.

## Processing Returns

Once you receive a return package, you need to create a "Customer Return". To do so, go to the order in question and click "Customer Returns". Click the "New Customer Return" button.

Select which of the authorized return items were received or mark all of them by simply clicking next to product on the left side checkbox, and to which [Stock Location](stock_locations). You can also set if the item that has been returned by the User is still **Resellable** or not. Once you are done, click the "Create" button.

The return items are marked as accepted, and now you can create a reimbursement for the $24.14 you owe the customer.

The reimbursement form will be populated according to your original reimbursement or exchange selections chosen during the return authorization form.  You may override the selected reimbursement type or exchange item now if you want to, otherwise click the "Reimburse" button to create the refund.

Your return-processing is complete! As you can see, there is $24.14 refund issued to the original credit card or Store credits to the user's account.
