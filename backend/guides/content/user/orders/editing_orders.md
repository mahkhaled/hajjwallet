## Introduction

There will come times when you need to edit orders that are placed in your store. Some examples:

* A customer may call you to adjust the quantity of items they want to purchase.
* You may sell out of an item and need to remove it from an item altogether.
* You may need to change the shipping being charged on an order.
* The customer holds a store credit you need to manually apply to their order.

## Editing an Order

First, go to your Admin Interface. Click the "Orders" tab, and [locate the order](searching_orders) you want to change.

This will bring up the order edit page:

You can change any of the following components of an order from here:

* [The types and quantities of products](entering_orders#add-products)
* [Shipping method](entering_orders#shipments)
* Tracking details for shipments
* [Customer information](entering_orders#customer-details)
* [Adjustments](entering_orders#adjustments)
* [Payment information](entering_orders#payments)
* [Return authorizations](returning_orders)
