## Introduction

Spree is a powerful e-commerce platform in its own right. Right out of the gate, it offers you a lot of functionality that can be customized to fit your store's particular needs.

Some customization scenarios are so common that developers have bundled them into [extensions](/developer/extensions_tutorial) - modules which can be added on to your store to extend its functionality. Consider asking your developer(s) to add one or more to your store. To see a complete list of Spree extensions, browse our [extension library](https://github.com/spree-contrib).

All of these extensions are open source - meaning they, like Spree itself, are offered free of charge. It also means they require support from the community contributors to keep them current and documented.
