title: Users
description: Use the Spree Commerce storefront API to access User data.
---

List users visible to the authenticated user. If the user is not an admin,
they will only be able to see their own user, unless they have custom
permissions to see other users. If the user is an admin then they can see all
users.

```text
GET /api/v1/users```

Users are paginated and can be iterated through by passing along a `page`
parameter:

```text
GET /api/v1/users?page=2```

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json(:user) do |h|
    { users: [h], count: 25, pages: 5, current_page: 1 }
end %>
