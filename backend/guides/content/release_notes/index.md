## Release Notes

Each major new release of Spree has an accompanying set of release notes.  The purpose of these notes is to provide a high level overview of what has changed since the previous version of Spree.

If you are upgrading to a new version of Spree that is several versions ahead of your current version, it is suggested that you update one version at a time and follow the release notes associated with each update.

You can find the detailed release notes for each version of Spree using the table of contents on the right hand side of this page.
