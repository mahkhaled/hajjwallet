## Major/New Features

3.4 is a smaller release to lay the groundwork for major new features
described in [Spree Development Roadmap](https://github.com/spree/spree/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).
It also contains number of bug fixes and improvements besides described in this document.

### Enhanced codebase quality

We've removed tons of unused & deprecated code and on top of that, we've updated
RuboCop rules and tidied up the code quality of all Spree modules.

### Enhanced Segment.com integration

We've added [Segment.com integration in Spree 3.3](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/release_notes/spree_3_3_0.html#segmentcom-tracker-integration)
but it was still limited. Since then we've put a lot of work to implement
tracking of nearly all e-commerce events supported by Segment.com.

### Updated User Documentation

We've updated the entire [User section](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/user/) of
[Spree Documentation](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/) also adding new content describing new features like
[Store Credits](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/user/configuring_store_credit_categories.html).

This is part of our [Guides 2.0 project](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/8270)

### Spree Frontend views exporter

You can easily copy all of the default spree views into
your project with just one command line:

```bash
rails g spree:frontend:copy_views
```

We hope will make frontend customization easier.

## Upgrade

### Update Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'spree', '~> 3.4.0'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 3.3'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.3'
```

### Update your extensions

We're changing how extensions dependencies work. Previously you had to match
extension branch to Spree branch. Starting from Spree 3.2 release `master` branch of all
`spree-contrib` extensions should work with Spree >= `3.1` and < `4.0`. Please change
your extensions in Gemfile eg.:

from:

```ruby
gem 'spree_braintree_vzero', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero', branch: '3-1-stable'
```

to:

```ruby
gem 'spree_braintree_vzero', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero'
```

### Run `bundle update`

### Install missing migrations

```bash
rails spree:install:migrations
rails spree_auth:install:migrations
rails spree_gateway:install:migrations
```

### Run migrations

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

### Other Gotchas

#### Migrate Spree::Taxon icons to Spree Assets

We changed `Spree::Taxon` icon to use `Spree::Asset` to unify attachment usage
across all Spree models. If you were using icon images in `Spree::Taxon`
please run this to migrate your icons:

```bash
rails db:migrate_taxon_icons
```


#### Noteworthy Changes

Also please review each of the noteworthy changes, and ensure your customizations
or extensions are not effected. If you are affected by a change, and have any
of your own tips please submit a PR to help the next person!
