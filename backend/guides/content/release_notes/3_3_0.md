## Major/New Features

### Rails 5.1 support

`Spree 3.3` is now compatible with `Rails 5.1` compared to `3.2` which used to run on `Rails 5.0`.
Thanks to that you can start using all of the [new great features available in Rails 5](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/5_1_release_notes.html)

### Ruby 2.4 support

Spree now works with Ruby `2.2` (`>= 2.2.7`), `2.3.x` and `2.4.x`.

### Segment.com tracker integration

We've extended Tracker system to include other trackers besides Google Analytics.
First of the bunch is [Segment](http://segment.com/) which enables you to
connect your store with over 200 analytics engines, CRMs, live chats, remarketing platforms,
A/B systems and much more. Now in Spree out of the box! No additional development required!

Developed during a [Spree hackaton](https://www.facebook.com/sparksolutions.co/posts/496593110678871).

### Preventing duplicate values for number fields

We've added unique indexes and uniqueness validation on `number` field for those models:

* `CustomerReturn`
* `Order`
* `Payment`
* `Reimbursement`
* `ReturnAuthorization`
* `Shipment`
* `StockTransfer`

This change will fix records with duplicate numbers. Migration scripts we're take care of that.

**WARNING** migration process can take considerable amount of time, depending on volume of your data

### Added missing indexes and unique indexes

Besides number fields we've added multiple regular & unique indexes that were missing. This will keep data consistency of your app in check and also will boost it performance.

### Add `quantity` to inventory units and split on demand

Optimising Shipments and Inventory Units.

* Creates a single `inventory_unit` per `state`, per `line_item`, per `stock_location` with a `quantity` field indicating inventory units in that state.
* Adds a `return_quantity` field in `ReturnAuthorization` indicating the number of units to be returned/exchanged.
* Split inventory unit to extract the portion/quantity that needs to be returned. This might be further split depending upon stock availability at the time of generating return.
* Changes prioritizer and adjuster to maximise the number of `on_hand` items from available stocks in multiple `stock_locations`
* Change `splitters/weight.rb` to use **Worst Fit** algo.

### Better Store Credits management in customer Frontend and Admin Panel

Store credit removal feature on spree front-end for partially paid order (with store credit payments). User can remove its store credit payment if additional payment is required/

Admin user can do the same from Admin Panel.

## Upgrade

### Update your Rails version to 5.1

Please follow the
[official Rails guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-5-0-to-rails-5-1)
to upgrade your store.

### Update Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'spree', '~> 3.3.0'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 3.3'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.3'
```

### Update your extensions

We're changing how extensions dependencies work. Previously you had to match
extension branch to Spree branch. Starting from Spree 3.2 release `master` branch of all
`spree-contrib` extensions should work with Spree >= `3.1` and < `4.0`. Please change
your extensions in Gemfile eg.:

from:

```ruby
gem 'spree_braintree_vzero', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero', branch: '3-1-stable'
```

to:

```ruby
gem 'spree_braintree_vzero', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_braintree_vzero'
```

### Run `bundle update`

### Install missing migrations

```bash
rails spree:install:migrations
rails spree_auth:install:migrations
rails spree_gateway:install:migrations
```

### Run migrations

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

### Other Gotchas

#### Include `UserMethods` in your `User` class

With this release we're not including this automatically. You need to do it manually if you're not using `spree_auth_devise`.

You need to include `Spree::UserMethods` in your user class, eg.

```ruby
class User
  include UserAddress
  include UserMethods
  include UserPaymentSource
end
```

#### Update `aws-sdk` gem to `>= 2.0`

Spree 3.3 comes with paperclip 5.1 support so if you're using Amazon S3 storage you need to change in your Gemfile, from:


```ruby
gem 'aws-sdk', '< 2.0'
```

to:

```ruby
gem 'aws-sdk', '>= 2.0'
```

and run `bundle update aws-sdk`

In your paperclip configuration you also need to specify
`s3_region` attribute eg. https://github.com/spree/spree/blame/master/guides/content/developer/customization/s3_storage.md#L27

Seel also [RubyThursday episode](https://rubythursday.com/episodes/ruby-snack-27-upgrade-paperclip-and-aws-sdk-in-prep-for-rails-5) walkthrough of upgrading paperclip in your project.

#### Add jquery.validate to your project if you've used it directly from Spree

If your application.js file includes line
 `//= require jquery.validate/jquery.validate.min`
you will need to add it this file manually to your project because this library was
[removed from Spree in favour of native HTML5 validation](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/8173).

#### Noteworthy Changes

Also please review each of the noteworthy changes, and ensure your customizations
or extensions are not effected. If you are affected by a change, and have any
of your own tips please submit a PR to help the next person!
