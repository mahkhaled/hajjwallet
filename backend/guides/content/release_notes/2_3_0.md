## Major/new features

### Rails 4.1 support

Rails 4.1 is now supported by Spree 2.3. If you wish to use Rails 4.1, Spree 2.3 is the release for you.

### Preferences serialized on records

Preferences are now stored on their records, rather than being stored in `spree_preferences`. This means that to fetch a preference for say, a calculator, one query needs to be done to the database for that row, as that row has the `preferences` column which contains all preferences. 

Previously, there would be a single DB call for the record itself, and then any number of database calls thereafter to fetch the required preference values for that record. What happens now is that there's only one database call, which means there should be some minor speedups.

### Better multi-store support

A `Spree::Store` model for basic multi-store/multi-domain support has been added.

This provides a basic framework for multi-store/multi-domain, based on the
spree-multi-domain extension. Some existing configuration has been moved to
this model, so that they can have different values depending on the site
being served:

* `Spree::Config[:site_name]` is moved to `name`
* `Spree::Config[:site_url]` is moved to `url`
* `Spree::Config[:default_meta_description]` is moved to `meta_description`
* `Spree::Config[:default_meta_keywords]` is moved to `meta_keywords`
* `Spree::Config[:default_seo_title]` is moved to `seo_title`

A migration will move existing configuration onto a new default store.

A new `ControllerHelpers::Store` concern provides a `current_store` helper
to fetch a helper based on the request's domain.

### Better guest user tracking

Now we are using a signed cookie to store the guests unique token
in the browser.  This allows customers who close their browser to
continue their shopping when they visit again.  More importantly
it allows you as a store owner to uniquely identify your guests orders.
Since we set `cookies.signed[:guest_token]` whenever a vistor comes
you may also use this cookie token on other objects than just orders.
For instance if a guest user wants to favorite a product you can
assign the `cookies.signed[:guest_token]` value to a token field on your
favorites model.  Which will then allow you to analyze the orders and
favorites this user has placed before which is useful for recommendations.

## Core

*   Drop first_name and last_name fields from spree_credit_cards.  Add
    first_name & last_name methods for now to keep ActiveMerchant happy.

    Jordan Brough

*   Replaced cookies.signed[:order_id] with cookies.signed[:guest_token].

    Now we are using a signed cookie to store the guests unique token
    in the browser.  This allows customers who close their browser to
    continue their shopping when they visit again.  More importantly
    it allows you as a store owner to uniquely identify your guests orders.
    Since we set cookies.signed[:guest_token] whenever a vistor comes

    favorites model.  Which will then allow you to analyze the orders and
    favorites this user has placed before which is useful for recommendations.

*   Order#token is no longer fetched from another table.

    Both Spree::Core::TokenResource and Spree::TokenizedPermission are deprecated.
    Order#token value is now persisted into spree_orders.guest_token. Main motivation
    here is save a few extra queries when creating an order. The TokenResource
    module was being of no use in spree core.

    NOTE: Watch out for the possible expensive migration that come along with this

    Washington L Braga Jr

*   Replaced session[:order_id] usage with cookies.signed[:order_id].

    Now we are using a signed cookie to store the order id on a guests
    browser client.  This allows customers who close their browser to
    continue their shopping when they visit again.
    Fixes #4319

*   Order#process_payments! no longer raises. Gateways must raise on failing authorizations.

    Now it's a Gateway or PaymentMethod responsability to raise a custom
    exception any time an authorization fails so that it can be rescued
    during checkout and proper action taken.

*   Assign request headers env to Payment when creating it via checkout.

    This might come in handy for some gateways, e.g. Adyen, actions that require
    data such as user agent and accept header to create user profiles. Previously
    we had no way to access the request headers from within a gateway class

*   More accurate and simpler Order#payment_state options.

    Balance Due. Paid. Credit Owed. Failed. These are the only possible values
    for order payment_state now. The previous `pending` state has been dropped
    and order updater logic greatly improved as it now mostly consider total
    values rather than doing last payment state checks.

    Huge thanks to dan-ding. See https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/4605

*   Config settings related to mail have been removed. This includes
    `enable_mail_delivery`, `mail_bcc`, `intercept_email`,
    `override_actionmailer_config`, `mail_host`, `mail_domain`, `mail_port`,
    `secure_connection_type`, `mail_auth_type`, `smtp_username`, and
    `smtp_password`.

    These should instead be [configured on actionmailer directly](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html#class-ActionMailer::Base-label-Configuration+options).
    The existing functionality can also be used by including the [spree_mail_settings](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_mail_settings) gem.

*   refactor the api to use a general importer in `lib/spree/importer/order.rb`

    Peter Berkenbosch

*   Ensure transition to payment processing state happens outside transaction.

    Chris Salzberg

*   Increase the precision of the amount/price columns in order for support other currencies. See https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/4657

*   Preferences on models are now stored in a serialized `preferences` column instead of the `Spree::Preferences` table.

    `Spree::Preferences` are still used for configuration (like `Spree::Config`).
    For models with preferences (`Calculator`, `PromotionRule`, and
    `PaymentMethod` in spree core) they are now serialized using
    `ActiveRecord::Base.serialize`, storing the preferences as YAML in the
    `preferences` column.

    ```
    > c = Spree::Calculator.first
    => #<Spree::Calculator::Shipping::FlatRate id: 1, type: "Spree::Calculator::Shipping::FlatRate",
    calculable_id: 1, calculable_type: "Spree::ShippingMethod", created_at: "2014-06-29 21:56:59",
    updated_at: "2014-06-29 21:57:00", preferences: {amount: 5, currency: "USD"}>
    > c.preferred_amount
    => 5
    > c.preferred_amount = 10
    => 10
    > c
    => #<Spree::Calculator::Shipping::FlatRate id: 1, type: "Spree::Calculator::Shipping::FlatRate",
    calculable_id: 1, calculable_type: "Spree::ShippingMethod", created_at: "2014-06-29 21:56:59",
    updated_at: "2014-06-29 21:57:00", preferences: {amount: 10, currency: "USD"}>
    ```

*   Add Spree::Store model for basic multi-store/multi-domain support

    This provides a basic framework for multi-store/multi-domain, based on the
    spree-multi-domain extension. Some existing configuration has been moved to
    this model, so that they can have different values depending on the site
    being served:

    * `Spree::Config[:site_name]` is moved to `name`
    * `Spree::Config[:site_url]` is moved to `url`
    * `Spree::Config[:default_meta_description]` is moved to `meta_description`
    * `Spree::Config[:default_meta_keywords]` is moved to `meta_keywords`
    * `Spree::Config[:default_seo_title]` is moved to `seo_title`

    A migration will move existing configuration onto a new default store.

    A new `ControllerHelpers::Store` concern provides a `current_store` helper
    to fetch a helper based on the request's domain.

## API

*   Support existing credit card feature on checkout.

    Checkouts_controller#update now uses the same Order::Checkout#update_from_params
    from spree frontend which help us to remove a lot of duplicated logic. As a
    result of that `payment_source` params must be sent now outsite the `order` key.

    Before you'd send a request like this:

    ```ruby
    api_put :update, id: order.to_param, order_token: order.guest_token,
      order: {
        payments_attributes: [{ payment_method_id: @payment_method.id.to_s }],
        payment_source: { @payment_method.id.to_s => { name: "Spree" } }
      }
    ```

    Now it should look like this:

    ```ruby
    api_put :update, id: order.to_param, order_token: order.guest_token,
      order: {
        payments_attributes: [{ payment_method_id: @payment_method.id.to_s }]
      },
      payment_source: {
        @payment_method.id.to_s => { name: "Spree" }
      }
    ```

*   api/orders/show now display credit cards as source under payment

    Washington Luiz

*   refactor the api to use a general importer in core gem.

    Peter Berkenbosch

* Shipment manifests viewed within the context of an order no longer return variant info. The line items for the order already contains this information. #4498

    * Ryan Bigg

## Frontend

*   The api key that was previously placed in the dom for ajax requests has been
    removed since the api now uses the session to authenticate the user.

*   Mostly inspired by Jeff Squires' extension spree_reuse_credit card, checkout
    now can remember user credit card info. Make sure your user model responds
    to a `payment_sources` method and customers will be able to reuse their
    credit card info.

    Washington Luiz

*   Use settings from current_store instead of Spree::Config

    Jeff Dutil, John Hawthorn, and Washington Luiz

## Backend

*   The api key that was previously placed in the dom for ajax requests has been
    removed since the api now uses the session to authenticate the user.
