## Spree Developer Documentation

This part of Spree's documentation covers the technical aspects of Spree. If you are working with Rails and are building a Spree store, this is the documentation for you.

**The best place to start is the [Getting Started guide](/developer/getting_started_tutorial.html).**

Otherwise, please see the [user documentation](/user/index.html).
